# Opening Trainer
A chess opening trainer using active recall and spaced repetition learning.

The project is stalled but I'm looking to get back on track. Feedback, collaboration offers, donations, general discussions on computer chess, please get in touch:

To open the trainer:
  1 	make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, along with the module `python-chess'. To install python-chess with pip, type `pip3 install python-chess'.
  2	open a terminal, navigate to the folder `Opening-Trainer' and type `python3 trainer.py'

Your terminal will need to support Unicode to draw the chess positions.

Further user instructions are in the file `manual.txt'.

Opening Trainer currently uses a command-line interface. If you are interesting in developing a front-end GUI, please contact me at `joshuablinkhorn@hotmail.co.uk'
