# Opening Trainer
A chess opening trainer using active recall and spaced repetition learning.

To open the trainer:
  1 	make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed, along with the module `python-chess'. To install python-chess with pip, type `pip3 install python-chess'.
  2	open a terminal, navigate to the folder `Opening-Trainer' and type `python3 trainer.py'

Your terminal will need to support Unicode to draw the chess positions.

Further user instructions are in the file `manual.txt'.

Opening Trainer currently uses a command-line interface. If you are interesting in developing a front-end GUI, please contact me at `joshuablinkhorn@hotmail.co.uk'
